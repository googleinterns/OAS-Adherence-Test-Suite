# OAS Adherence Test Suite

OAS Adherence Test Suite will allow a user to test whether an API is correctly
implemented as per a defined OpenAPI Specification. The intention is to call
an implemented API and validate basic assumptions and requirements such as

- Resources
- Data Types
- Enumerations
- Required / Optional fields
- Error Responses

We will add more as we build and develop this project.

**Note**: This is not meant to be a functional test suite. It cannot make
semantically correct calls and cannot also chain calls. It's only purpose is
to give the API Spec creator or consumer the confidence that the API is
implemented correctly as per the spec and is ready to consume without fear
of mismatched expectations of request / response.

The aim is that this project will reduce manual reviews of OpenAPI Spec
implementations and faster development as well as time to integration.

This template uses the Apache license, as is Google's default. See the
documentation for instructions on using alternate license.

## Basic Requirements
* OAS Document should be in JSON format.
* Version of the OAS Document should be v3.0 (Latest version of OpenApi Spec).

Visit [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to convert your OpenApi Spec to the required format. 

## Commands
> #### Note: App can serve the users through interative cli as well. Users will be asked/prompted for necessary data if not provided through command options. Also, users can just type    ```ats <command>``` to start a complete interactive cli flow. 

### Generate testsuite 
**Generates testsuite containing testcases for all the api endpoints present in the OAS 3.0 document.**
```bash
ats generate [--oaspath <oaspath>] [--testsuitepath <testsuitepath>] [--overridespath <overridespath>] [--verbose]
```
#### Options
* ```--oaspath <oaspath>```: Path of OAS 3.0 document.
* ```--testsuitepath <testsuitepath>```: Path where the generated testsuite is saved.
* ```--overridespath <overridespath>```: Path of Overrides file.
* ```--verbose```: Provides more information about events that occur through logs.
#### Examples
* ```--oaspath="/foldername/petstore.json" ```
* ```--testsuitepath="/foldername/petstore_1.0.5_testsuite.json" ```
* ```--overridespath="/ats/overrides.json" ```
* ```--verbose ```

### Validate API Endpoints
**Validates the API Endpoints against the OpenAPI Specification.**
```bash
ats validate [--testsuitepath <testsuitepath>] [--oaspath <oaspath>] [--overridespath <overridespath>]
[--baseURL <baseURL>] [--apiendpoints <apiendpoints>] [--apikeys <apikeys>] [--basicauth <basicauth>] 
[--saveconfigto <configpath>] [--uploadconfigfrom <configpath>] [--timeout <timeout>] [--verbose]
```
#### Options
* ```--testsuitepath <testsuitepath>```: Path of testsuite. (App runs testcases present in the testsuite)
* ```--oaspath <oaspath>```: Path of OAS 3.0 document. (App runs testcases which are generated against the provided OAS 3.0 document)
* ```--overridespath <overridespath>```: Path of Overrides file.
* ```--baseURL <baseURL>```: BaseURL
* ```--apiendpoints <apiendpoints>```: API Endpoints that needs to be validated.
* ```--apikeys <apikeys>```: API Keys used for Authentication/Authorisation.
* ```--basicauth <basicauth>```: Basic Authentication Credentials (username, password).
* ```--saveconfigto <configpath>```: Updates/Creates a config file with config object in configpath.
* ```--uploadconfigfrom <configpath>```: Reads the config object from the config file present in the configpath. 
* ```--timeout <timeout>```: Specifies the number of milliseconds before the request times out. (Default: 5000 ms)
* ```--verbose```: Provides more descriptive test results and information about events that occur through logs.
#### Examples
* ```--testsuitepath="/foldername/petstore_1.0.5_testsuite.json" ```
* ```--oaspath="/foldername/petstore.json" ```
* ```--overridespath="/ats/overrides.json" ```
* ```--baseURL="http://www.ats.com" ```
* ```--apiendpoints='[{"path": "/pet", "httpMethod": "post"} , {"path": "/store", "httpMethod": "post"}]'```
* ```--apikeys='[{"name": "X-API-KEY", "value":"foo"}, {"name": "X-API-KEY_DUP", "value": "bar"}]' ```
* ```--basicauth='{"username": "sundar", "password": "sundar@123"}' ```
* ```--saveconfigto="/foldername/petstore_config.json" ```
* ```--uploadconfigfrom="/foldername/petstore_config.json" ```
* ```--timeout=9000 ```
* ```--verbose ```

## Additional Information
### Overrides 
Testcases generated by the app contains random values complying with the schema for request body and request headers.
In order to have a reserved/fixed value for a field, the user can take help of the overrides option provided by the app.

#### File Structure of Overrides 
```json
{
  "{{path}}": {
    "{{httpMethod}}": {
      "requestBody": {
        "{{fieldName}}": "{{value}}"
      },
      "responseHeaders": {
        "{{headerName}}": "{{value}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
#### Example
```json
{
  "/v1/petowner": {
    "post": {
      "requestBody": {
        "name": {
          "firstname": "foo",
          "lastname": "bar"
        },
        "requestId": "abcd123",
        "requestTimestamp": {
          "epochMillis": 1594940819161
        }
      }
    },
    "requestHeaders": {
      "X-CSRF-Token": "IuwgtXZjlQ"
    }
  }
}
```

### Config 
Active users of the app can store the command-options's values in the config file. Therefore, the users don't 
need to provide all the options everytime they want to run a command, they can simply upload the config file.

#### Command Options
* ```--saveconfigto <configpath>```
* ```--uploadconfigfrom <configpath>```

#### Options that can be stored in the config file are:
* testsuitepath
* apiendpoints
* baseURL
* apikeys
* basicauth
* timeout

## Developer Guide

### Run Unit Tests

```bash 
  npm test
```
**Note**:  On running the command, along with running the tests it will generate the code-coverage report as well. 

### Generate Documentation for the Source Code
```bash
  npm run generate-docs
```
**Highly recommended for new contributors of the app to generate the doc and get an overview of all modules present.**
